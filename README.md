# coding-quiz
This challenge wasn't easy, but I tried to do my best.
I used every knowledge we learned about this week.
First I created 3 javascript file, one for the questions, one for the scores and one for the logic. I worked on the logic the most.
First I made variables to acces the elements in the html file. 
I wrote all of my questions and answers and stored them in an array of objects in the question.js file.
I created functions and event listeners to be able to iterate through the questions of this game. You can find more explanation about them in the comments. And then I stored the user input and the scores in the local storage and accessed them on my other javascript page for the highscores and made it visible on the page, creating a new list. I think I've had the most complications with this part and it's still not perfect, but I'm already late with my assignment, so I decided to submit it, just how it is. I've put in a lot of work for this one, and found it really challenging but I think I've learned a lot during the process and it was a very good practise for me.

Here's the URL for the deployed application:
