# coding-quiz
This weekâ€™s challenge was to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
The features of the application:
- When the start button is clicked, the timer starts to count down from 100 and the questions appear on the screen
- When the right answer is clicked, it plays an audio sound and moves to the next question.
- When the wrong answer is clicked, it plays an audio sound, the user loses 10 seconds of time, and moves to the next question.
- If there are no more questions, the game is finished.
- If there's no more time, the game is finished.
- The remaining time will be the user's score and it will be displayed on the screen.
- The user can write and save their initials and scores.
- If the user goes to the highscores page, their scores and initials will be displayed on the screen.
- If the user clicks on the clear highscores button, the local storage will be cleared.
- The timer stops at 0.
